== Strings

.String format specifiers
[cols="^1s,5"]
|===
| Format | Description

| s | The argument is treated and presented as a string _(default for strings)_
|===

== Numbers

.Number format specifiers
[cols="^1s,5"]
|===
| Format | Description

| b | The argument is treated as an integer and presented as a binary number
| c | The argument is treated as an integer and presented as the character with that ASCII
| d | The argument is treated as an integer and presented as a (signed) decimal number _(default for integers)_
| e | The argument is treated as scientific notation (e.g. 1.2e+2). The precision specifier stands for the number of digits after the decimal point
| E | Like the e specifier but uses uppercase letter (e.g. 1.2E+2)
| f | The argument is treated as a float and presented as a floating-point number (locale aware)
| F | The argument is treated as a float and presented as a floating-point number (non-locale aware)
| g |
General format.

Let P equal the precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero. Then, if a conversion with style E would have an exponent of X:

If P > X ≥ −4, the conversion is with style f and precision P − (X + 1). Otherwise, the conversion is with style e and precision P − 1.

| G | Like the g specifier but uses E and f
| o | The argument is treated as an integer and presented as an octal number
